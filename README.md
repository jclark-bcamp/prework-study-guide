# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a prework study guide with notes on various topics for bootcamp students to refer to.

- The motivation for this was to have a place where all of the notes for prework are easily accessed.
- I built this project to familiarize myself with basic HTML, CSS, and JS as well as familiarizing myself with the Github workflow.
- This is to help organize what we've learned.
- We learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JaveScript and put them into practice with this bootcamp project.
