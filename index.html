        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attribute defines additional information about an element and is always defined in the beginning of the element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about a webpage that a browser uses to effectively serve the page to users.</li>
          <li>Inside the <b>< head ></head></b> element, you can use the metadata tag <b>< title ></title></b> to define the page. This is required and important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements describe its contents and the role is plays on a web page. This makes html easier to read and plays an important role in accessibility for a wide range of users. <b>< body ></body></b> is an example of this.</li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An <b>element</b> refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a <b>tag</b> refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS.</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Inline CSS:</b> these apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute to apply style to a particular page element.</li>
            <li><b>Internal style sheet:</b> contains CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules will only apply to that particluar page.</li>
            <li><b>External style sheet:</b> preferred in most cases. Allows devs to keep all CSS rules in a seperate file & makes changes easier. Used by placing a file via link placed in the HTMLs head.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Declarations</b> contain two components: the CSS property and the value of that property. Example: color:blue;</li>
          <li><b>Margin</b> property acts like a margin in a word doc. It applies to the <u>outside</u> of an element.</li>
          <li><b>Padding</b> adds spaces around the content <u>inside</u> an element. When padding is increased, so is the size of the element.</li>
          <li><b>*</b> will apply a rule to all elements visible on the page. Using this declares all will have the same style properties.</li>
          <li><b>DRY code</b>, or Do Not Repeat Yourself, is a principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines and complexity in a codebase.</li>

            <li><b>Repo</b> or repository is a folder for your project that contains all files and their revision history.</li>
            <li><b>Branch</b> is a workspace where you can make changes that don't affect your <b>main</b> branch or live site.</li>
            <li><b>Markdown</b> or .md is the way content files are formatted in Github.</li>
            <li><b>Commit changes</b> is saving a new version of a file you are working on; adding changes to your branch.</li>
            <li><b>Pull request</b>, or PR, is asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch.</li>
            <li><b>Merge</b> is when a PR is approved, changes are "pulled in" or merged into the main branch.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>JS is a tool that takes a static HTML/CSS page and makes it more interactive.</li>
          <li>The word <b>console</b> refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li><b>Variable</b> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li><b>const</b> is a keyword that allows us to create a variable that can't be reassigned a value.</li>
          <li><b>=</b> is an assignment operator thats assigns specific data that want stored in the variable.</li>
          <li>In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. This is called the <b>control flow.</b></li>
          <li><b>if</b> will only excecute code if a statement meets a condition.</li>
          <li>When a computer encounters an <b>if</b> statement, it will check to see if the provided information is <b>truthy.</b></li>
          <li><b>Array</b> is a group of related data in a single variable and is typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Note: Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>for loop</b> uses a predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by following a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li><b>length</b> is equal to the number of items in an array.</li>
          <li>A <b>function</b> is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task.</li>
